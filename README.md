# Mapping Terrorism: Interactive Insights from Global Data

Welcome to the **Interactive Terrorism Visualization Project**. This project provides an insightful, user-friendly way to explore and analyze the data surrounding terrorist attacks worldwide, offering a clear understanding of the trends, patterns, and global impact of terrorism. The visualization leverages the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, an extensive dataset that includes information on over **180,000 terrorist attacks** from **1970 through 2017**.

## Dataset Overview

The data used in this project comes from the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, an open-source collection maintained by the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland. The GTD compiles detailed information on terrorist incidents, including both **domestic and international attacks**, that occurred between **1970 and 2017**. This comprehensive dataset serves as one of the largest repositories for terrorism-related data, making it a valuable resource for research and analysis.

The dataset includes the following key information for each attack:
- Date, location, and region of the attack
- Type of attack (e.g., bombing, armed assault)
- Target and perpetrators
- Casualties and fatalities

## Features of the Visualization

This interactive tool allows users to dive deep into the data and visualize key patterns and trends. Key features include:

1. **Region and Country Selection**:  
   Users can select specific regions and countries to filter the data and focus on the areas of interest. This feature allows you to narrow down the visualization to particular geographic locations and understand local patterns of terrorism.

2. **Interactive Map of Attacks**:  
   An interactive map displays the locations of terrorist attacks around the world. Users can zoom in and out, and click on individual markers to view details about specific incidents, including the type of attack and the number of casualties.

3. **Trends Over Time**:  
   A chart depicting the **count of attacks** and **casualties** over time gives insight into how terrorist activities have evolved. By examining the trends, users can identify peaks, declines, and shifts in global terrorism over the years.

4. **Types of Attacks**:  
   A chart categorizes the different types of attacks (e.g., bombings, assaults, hijackings) and shows how their prevalence has changed over time. This visualization helps users understand the tactics employed by terrorists across different time periods.

5. **Perpetrators of Attacks**:  
   Another chart highlights who is responsible for the attacks, whether it is a terrorist group, individuals, or unknown entities. This feature allows users to examine patterns in the actors behind terrorist activities and how they have evolved over time.

## Upcoming Features

I am continuously working on improving and expanding the functionality of this visualization. Future updates will include:
- More detailed filtering options for users to further refine their searches
- Enhanced charts and data analysis features
- Additional regions and attack types for deeper insights

## How to Use

- **Select Region and Country**: Use the dropdown menus to select a specific region or country to filter the data.
- **Explore the Map**: The interactive map shows the locations of terrorist attacks worldwide. Click on any marker to view more details about the specific attack.
- **Examine the Charts**: The charts provide insights into trends over time, attack types, and perpetrators of attacks. Use these charts to explore how global terrorism has evolved over the years.

## Conclusion

This project is designed to provide an accessible and informative overview of terrorism worldwide, helping users understand complex patterns and trends in terrorist activity. By visualizing the data in an interactive format, the goal is to create a tool that supports both casual exploration and in-depth analysis.

Thank you for using the **Interactive Terrorism Visualization Project**. Feel free to explore and learn more about global terrorism patterns and their impact.
